          Users connect to servers by use of the internet. When we do this we are asking servers for documents that are written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"> HTML</a>. The server responds by sending us the documents, that our web browers interprets into what we see in the browser. Hyper text mark up is simply the language that our web browser uses to display text, image, and other references.

      1.2 Hyper Text Markup Language

        <div class="conceptdescription">
          <p>
            HTML is made up of smaller parts - texts, markup, and references. Instructions are notated by elements, inside of tags. Examples of tags include: 
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. &lt;b&gt; - is the bold tag which bolds the content within the open and closing b tag.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. &lt;em&gt; - is the emphasis tag, which italicizes the content
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. &lt;img&gt; - is the image tag. This tag links the content to a specific image url. Also, this tag has no closing tag because it is a void tag.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. &lt;br&gt; - is the break tag. The break tag inserts a line break, this is needed because HTML truncates spaces if not instructed to do otherwise.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. &lt;p&gt; - is the paragraph tag. The paragraph tag is similar to the break tag, however it is consider a block tag instead of an inline tag. My understanding of the p tag is limited for now, but I believe it treats the content of the element seperately, which allows customability.

          <p>
          A website has structure much like a hierarchy of branches and boxes There is a lot on a page when we look at it visually. However, the structure of a webpage is made of boxes. These boxes can be on top of each other, next to each other, and within each other. However by understanding that everything is in a box and branch structure, we can begin to make these boxses listen to our rules.

          The styling for HTML elements are managed by CSS - <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets>Cascasing Style Sheets</a>. CSS allows you to use a specific syntax and rules to change how HTML element look. To be specific, you can tell a element, with "X" class, to have a background color of red.

        3.1 Presentation vs Content
        </div>
          <div class="conceptdescription">
            <p>
          One of CSS's use is the presentation of document content. This includes "layout, colors, and fonts". This "styling" is important, because it allows the writer to present the content in a way that engages the author and can make information more meaningful. For example, with CSS you can make similar class headings the same color or bold, making them aesthetically pleasing. CSS also allows you to "present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (when read out by a speech-based browser or screen reader) and on Braille-based, tactile devices."

        3.2 Avoiding Repetition with CSS
        </div>
          <div class="conceptdescription">
            <p>
          The reason CSS avoids repetition is because it reduces the complexity of the html structure. Instead of coding style for all elements in HTML, you can apply the whole document to a set of style. This allows the page to be widely formatted with CSS. Not so say CSS is simple, but it is very efficient when styling HTML.
